# Wordle
Analysing word choices for Wordle

This repo consists of 1) a script to pull potential guesses from the Wordle website (Wordle_words)
and 2) a program to use this data to help with Wordle guesses.

Using the words obtained from the first script I have obtained the following heat map which can be used to inform wordle guesses (as seen in the file "Wordle_guesses").
